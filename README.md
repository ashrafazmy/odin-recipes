# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes will be the first project under The Odin Project to build a recipe website with my new knowledge of HTML. This project will be revisited in the future for further styling with CSS.

The skills that will be demonstrated in this HTML project would be 
- The knowledge on the basic html boilerplate
- The different levels of headings and how it can give importance to the info
- The use of the <a> tag with the attribute href as it is used as a hyperlink, and href indicate the destination of the link
- Learned basic website building structure
- Unordered and ordered lists were used to show the ingredients and steps, respectively
- Images, such as jpg and gif were also used, with the <img> tag and 'src' attribute
- <strong> tags were used to make the text bold
